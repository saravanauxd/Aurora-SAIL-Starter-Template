## What This Power Does

This Power handles the entire Aurora MCP setup process automatically:

2. **Clones Aurora MCP** - Downloads the server from GitHub
3. **Installs dependencies** - Runs npm install
4. **Builds the server** - Compiles the MCP server
5. **Configures Kiro** - Updates `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with the correct path
6. **Validates setup** - Tests the connection

The Power will guide you through any decisions and handle the technical details automatically.
